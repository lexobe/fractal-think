# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

**Preview/Testing the Snake Game:**
- `open index.html` (macOS) or open directly in any browser
- Or serve locally: `python3 -m http.server 8000` then visit `http://localhost:8000/`
- Manual testing checklist:
  - Space toggles start/pause; `R` resets; arrow keys move; no 180Â° reversal
  - Score increments; speed increases every 5 foods; overlay messages correct
  - Collision with wall/self triggers game over; no Console errors

**Development Workflow:**
- No build system required - edit `index.html` or Markdown files directly and refresh browser
- Use browser DevTools Console for debugging JavaScript errors

**Python Script Execution:**
- Run the fractal thinking framework: `python3 thinkon.py`

## Code Architecture

### Core Components

**Fractal Thinking Framework (`thinkon.py`):**
- Implements a recursive problem-solving framework with minimal structure
- Core data structure: `Node` with `goal`, `context`, and `parent` fields
- Two main action types: `Down` (recurse to child) and `ReturnUp` (return result)
- Strategy pattern via `Strategy` protocol with `think()` and `eval()` methods
- Built-in `AnchoredPlanStrategy` for plan-based recursive execution

**Snake Game (`index.html`):**
- Single-file implementation using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- No external dependencies or build system
- Canvas-based game with keyboard controls
- Self-contained styling and game logic

### Framework Patterns

**Recursive Problem Solving:**
- Each `Node` represents a problem/subproblem with a specific goal
- `Strategy.think()` decides whether to decompose (Down) or solve directly (ReturnUp)
- `Strategy.eval()` processes child results and decides next action
- Pure natural language context storage - no structured fields

**Language and Content:**
- Documentation primarily in Chinese with technical English terms
- UI/docs use Chinese; code comments and variable names in English
- Markdown documentation follows hierarchical structure with clear sections

## Coding Standards

**HTML/CSS/JavaScript:**
- 2-space indentation
- Prefer `const/let` over `var`
- Keep functions small and pure
- Avoid external frameworks for simplicity

**Python:**
- Use dataclasses for structured data
- Type hints with Protocol for interfaces
- Clear separation between data structures and algorithms

**File Organization:**
- Keep single-file implementations when possible (`index.html`)
- Use kebab-case for new documentation files
- Place assets under `assets/` directory if needed

## Testing Guidelines

**Manual Testing for Snake Game:**
- Verify canvas remains focusable with `tabindex="0"`
- Test all keyboard controls (arrows, space, R)
- Check game state transitions and scoring
- Ensure accessibility with proper `aria-label`

**Framework Testing:**
- Test recursive execution with sample problems
- Verify strategy implementations follow Protocol
- Check parent-child relationships in Node hierarchy
